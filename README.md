# About
The use of GPS navigation software is increasingly used to guide drivers to their 
desired destination, not the least by taxi drivers. That's not the only use for a GPS though. 
Many smartphones now include GPS to provide guidance, and it's also used for Geocaching, a “high-tech treasure hunting game”
where you navigate and try to find treasures, called geocaches, outdoors and indoors and then share your experiences.

# Requirements of the project
The project team shall deliver a GPS navigation software based on the GPSMAP 62st 
including modifications by the team, such as creative additions and improvements. In 
addition to this, the project team shall deliver a requirement specification and a design 
specification for the system under construction. The design shall be implemented, and 
result in working and tested software.
The functional requirements are at a minimum that the navigation system:
• should be able to read a set of geocache coordinates from a provided LOC file4
,
4 See http://www.cachemaps.com/Loc-syntax.htm for a description of the LOC file format.
Page 3 of 11• should be able to navigate the user to any of the geocache locations in the LOC 
file,
• should be able to guide the user around buildings, fences, and other obstacles.
Make sure you provide and include the following:
• A software requirement specification
• A design specification, including class diagrams and use case realisations
• Implemented design resulting in a working and tested software prototype that 
meets the above requirements
• Product and sprint backlogs that adequately record the team’s work
While you are allowed to use existing code or open source applications, you must 
write a substantial part of the code in the project yourself and clearly label your 
contributions as such.

# Software
The software needs to be written in Java, but you're invited to use whichever tool you 
feel most comfortable with in the team.
